The goal of this project is to discover, as a whole, the software platform that you have chosen through the
creation of a business application.
To do this, you must implement a software suite that functions similar to that of IFTTT and/or Zapier.
This software suite will be broken into three parts :

   • An application server to implement all the features listed below (see Features)
   • A web client to use the application from your browser by querying the application server
   • A mobile client to use the application from your phone by querying the application server
